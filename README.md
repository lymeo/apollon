## Presentation

Project apollon's goal is to simplify GraphQl API development and to offer a modulable structure to start building an API in minutes.

It is based on the apollo server library that can be found [here](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server).

Some of the features:

* Authentication and initialization hook
* GraphQl playground to test and interact with your API
* Subscriptions for real time synchronisation with the API
* Clean working structure separating resolvers, schema, connectors, directives and types
* JSON logging, ready for your favorite log aggregation tool

## Requirements

Essential

* NodeJs (minimum v10) or Docker

Optional

* [Bunyan cli tool](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)
* [Nodemon cli tool](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)

## Getting started

Go to our [releases page](https://github.com/lymeo/apollon/releases/) and download your desired version. Unzip the sources if you have downloaded an archive go to the root of the project where there is a `package.json` file. Depending on your package manager enter one of the following commands:

```shell
npm i
```

```shell
yarn
```

Once the installation completed enter the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

If (we recommend) you have the bunyan cli tool you could also enter this command for prettier logs

```shell
npm run dev | bunyan
```

After a couple of milliseconds your server should be up and running

## The schema

The GraphQl schema in **apollon**  is seperated into different files inside the root `schema` directory. You can generate a full schema if needed with the following command 

```
npm run schema
```

And will find the resulting file in a new root `dist`  directory.

## The resolvers

Resolvers are implemented in the resolver directory and are defined in an exported javascript function:

```javascript
module.exports = function(schema, helpers) {

};
```

Apollon passes into this function the current schema implementation and and object containing helpers.

The schema implementation contains three keys that are used to implement the specification schema.

```javascript
schema.Query;
schema.Mutation;
schema.Subscription;
```

A resolver example:

```javascript
module.exports = function(schema, helpers) {

    let {Query, Mutation} = schema;


    // Type 

    schema.Comment = {
        author: (root, _, {connectors: { local } }) => {
            return local.users.filter(user => user.id == root.author)[0];
        },
 
    }


    // Queries

    Query.comments = (root, _, {connectors: { local }}) => {
        return local.comments;
    }


    // Mutations

    Mutation.comment_delete = (root, { id }, {connectors: {local}}) => {
        local.comments = local.comments.filter(comment => comment.id != id);
        return id;
    }

    new helpers.SimpleSubscription("comment_deleted");
};
```
Each resolver is passed in 3 parameters: the root object, the parameters and the context

> You can access the context object in most scopes in apollon. It contains usefull elements to access global objects.
 
```javascript
Query.comments = (root, parameters, context) => {
    return context.connectors.local.comments;
}

// Is the same as
Query.comments = (root, _, {connectors: { local }}) => {
    return local.comments;
}
```

## The connectors

The connectors are used inside the app to access data sources. They are defined in the root `connectors`  directory.

Each file is added to the `context.connectors` object based on it's file name and whatever the exported asynchronous function returns is there on out used as the actual connector

Example:

```javascript
let users = [
  {
    id: '0',
    name: 'Homer'
  },
  {
    id: '1',
    name: 'Bart'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    name: 'Moe'
  }
];

let comments = [
  {
    id: '0',
    content: "Je suis un commentaire",
    author: '0',
  },
  {
    id: '1',
    content: "Mais non tu es Homer !",
    author: '1',
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    content: "Ah",
    author: '2',
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    content: "...",
    author: '1'
  }
]


module.exports = async function() {
  return {
    users,
    comments
  };
```

> This could have exported any other kind of data source for example a MySql connection or a Mongoose client

## The src root directory

This directory contains apollon's code. Nothing magic a simple express server with the different middleware feel free to change whatever you want or to make a PR if a feature seems interesting.

## Demo

A demo project using subscriptions and the apollo client is also available on a release page please check it out if you need more details. You can alternatively browse the source code on [the demo branch](https://github.com/lymeo/apollon/tree/demo).
